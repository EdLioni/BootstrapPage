  <p style="color: white; padding-top: 3%; padding-bottom: 3%; ">NATO Leaders are meeting in Madrid at a pivotal time for our security. Russia's war against Ukraine has shattered peace in Europe, caused far-reaching energy and food crises, and shaken the rules-based international order. NATO's response has been swift and united.
    <br> <br>
    More than ever, NATO is the indispensable platform for transatlantic consultations and cooperation on security and defence. At the Madrid Summit, Allies will continue to adapt, taking decisions to keep NATO strong and ready in a more dangerous world. Heads of State and Government will agree to strengthen deterrence and defence, and support Ukraine for the longer term. They will agree the 2022 Strategic Concept, which will be a roadmap for the Alliance in the years to come. Allies will also boost cooperation with partners, enhance resilience and sharpen NATO's technological edge – all underpinned by the necessary investments in our collective defence.</p>

              <h2>I. Strengthening NATO's long-term deterrence and defence</h2>
              <p>NATO is a defensive Alliance. In response to the new security reality, the Alliance has reinforced its ability to protect and defend every inch of Allied territory. There are now over 40,000 troops under direct NATO command, backed by air and naval assets. NATO has doubled the number of battlegroups to eight, extending from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south.<br><br>
              At the Summit, NATO Leaders will significantly strengthen the Alliance's posture for the long term, with more presence, capabilities and readiness. Ensuring NATO remains fit for the future will require adequate resources and continued investment in defence.</p>

            <h2>II. Sustaining support for Ukraine</h2>
            <p>Allies are providing strong military and financial support to help Ukraine uphold its right to self-defence, as enshrined in the United Nations Charter. This builds on years of NATO training and assistance since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Allies have significantly stepped up with billions of euros' worth of additional lethal and non-lethal aid to help Ukraine prevail. At the Summit, Allied Heads of State and Government will meet with Ukraine and agree to step up and sustain NATO support for the longer term.</p>

            <h2>III. Launching NATO's 2022 Strategic Concept </h2>
            <p>Strategic concepts equip the Alliance to respond to current security challenges and guide its political and military development so that it is equally prepared to face the challenges of tomorrow. Apart from NATO's founding treaty, they are the Alliance's most important documents, serving as a blueprint for future adaptation. In Madrid, Leaders will endorse a new Strategic Concept, which will assess our changed security environment and reaffirm NATO's values, purpose and tasks. It will set out NATO's joint positions, including on Russia and emerging challenges, and for the first time, it will also address China.</p>

            <h2>IV. Reinforcing partnerships and maintaining an Open Door</h2>
            <p> In an era of strategic competition, as authoritarian regimes contest core principles for our security, the Alliance must work even more closely with like-minded countries and organisations. NATO's partnership with the European Union has reached unprecedented levels. Finland and Sweden have taken historic decisions to join NATO, demonstrating the importance of the Open Door policy. At the Summit, NATO will further step up support to Georgia and other partners to build their capabilities and strengthen their resilience. The leaders of our Asia-Pacific partners Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea and New Zealand are taking part for the first time in a NATO Summit.

            <h2>V. Adapting to threats and challenges from any direction</h2>
            <p>The Madrid Summit is an important milestone in NATO's ongoing adaptation to address threats and challenges from any direction. These include terrorism, cyber attacks, China's coercive policies, disruptive technologies and the security impact of climate change.  A broad approach to security also includes a strong focus on resilience – NATO's first line of defence.<br><br>
            NATO Leaders will take decisions to maintain our technological edge, including through the new Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic and a billion euro Innovation Fund, to support start-ups and develop cutting-edge solutions to security challenges. <br><br>
            Climate change is a defining challenge of our time, and Allies are working to incorporate it into everything the Organization does. At the Summit, Leaders will agree a new methodology to map military greenhouse gas emissions, and a target to help NATO contribute to the goal of Net Zero.

            <h2>VI. Transatlantic unity and Alliance solidarity</h2>
            <p>NATO is the most successful alliance in history. The transatlantic bond between Europe and North America has ensured our freedom and security for over 70 years. Today, as we face the most serious security situation in decades, the Alliance is rising to the challenge with unity and resolve. The decisions that Leaders take in Madrid will ensure that NATO continues to preserve peace, prevent conflict and protect our people and our values.
